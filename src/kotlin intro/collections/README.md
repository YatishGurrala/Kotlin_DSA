# Collections in Kotlin

Collections in Kotlin are used to store and manipulate groups of related elements. They are a fundamental part of the language's standard library, providing a variety of data structures to work with different types of data efficiently.

## Types of Collections

### Immutable Collections

Immutable collections in Kotlin are read-only and cannot be modified after creation. They include:
- **Lists**: Ordered collections that allow duplicate elements.
- **Sets**: Collections that do not allow duplicates and do not maintain order.
- **Maps**: Collections of key-value pairs where each key is unique.

### Mutable Collections

Mutable collections, unlike immutable ones, allow modification after creation. They include:
- **MutableList**: A list that supports adding, removing, and updating elements.
- **MutableSet**: A set allowing modifications to its elements.
- **MutableMap**: A map enabling addition, removal, and update of key-value pairs.

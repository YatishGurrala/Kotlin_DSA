# Kotlin Optionals and Null Safety

This topic is to explore Kotlin's Optionals and Null Safety, essential features designed to handle null values and prevent null pointer exceptions (NPEs).

## Introduction

Kotlin, a modern programming language, introduces powerful features to manage nullability, ensuring safer code execution by eliminating unexpected null references. Understanding Optionals and Null Safety is crucial for writing robust and reliable Kotlin code.

## Concepts Covered

### Nullable Types (Optionals)

In Kotlin, a type followed by a question mark `?` denotes a nullable type, allowing variables to hold null values explicitly.

### Null Safety Operators

- **Safe Call Operator `?.`**: Allows safe invocation of methods or access to properties on nullable types, preventing NPEs.
- **Elvis Operator `?:`**: Provides a default value if an expression evaluates to null.
- **Safe Cast Operator `as?`**: Safely tries to cast a value to a specified type and returns null if the cast is unsuccessful.
- **Not-null Assertion Operator `!!`**: Asserts that a nullable value is not null, but if it is, throws an NPE.

# Functions in Kotlin

Functions are a fundamental building block in Kotlin, offering a versatile way to encapsulate logic and enable code reuse. This README provides an overview of Kotlin functions and their various features.

### Function Declaration

In Kotlin, functions are declared using the `fun` keyword followed by the function name. They can have parameters and a return type (if any).

### Function Parameters

Parameters are defined within parentheses after the function name. They consist of a name and a type. Kotlin supports default values for parameters and named arguments.

### Return Types

Functions can specify a return type using `: Type` after the parentheses. If a function doesn't return any meaningful value, its return type is `Unit` (similar to `void` in other languages).

### Single-Expression Functions

For concise functions with a single expression, you can omit curly braces and use an expression directly as the body of the function.

### Higher-Order Functions

Kotlin supports higher-order functions, allowing functions to be passed as parameters or returned from other functions. This enables powerful functional programming capabilities.

But for now we will only cover Function - declaration,parameters and return types for this DSA course

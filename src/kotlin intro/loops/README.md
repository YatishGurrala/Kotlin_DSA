# Loops in Kotlin

Loops are fundamental programming structures in Kotlin that enable the repetition of code execution based on certain conditions. They allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met.

## Types of Loops in Kotlin

### 1. For Loops
The `for` loop in Kotlin is used to iterate over a range of values or collections. It's particularly useful for iterating through sequences of elements, such as ranges, arrays, or other iterable collections.

### 2. While Loops
Kotlin supports the `while` loop, which repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition remains true. It evaluates the condition before each iteration.

### 3. Do-While Loops
Kotlin also provides the `do-while` loop, which is similar to the `while` loop but with a key difference: it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition. After the first execution, it evaluates the condition and continues to execute the block if the condition holds true.

### 4. Break and Continue Statements
The `break` statement exits a loop when a certain condition is met, while `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
